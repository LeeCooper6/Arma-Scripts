  "body": "# Welcome\r\n\r\nWelcome to my repository of Arma scripts!\r\n\r\nI've specifically designed these scripts to be user-friendly to non-technical (non-programmer) players who just want things to work but don't have the time or knowledge to learn scripting and code.\r\n\r\n## What Are Scripts?\r\n\r\nScripts are little files of code run in-game that to do all sorts of wonderful and amazing things - or horrible things, depending on how you set it up (with great power comes great responsibility and all that).\r\n\r\nScripts in Arma are typically either .sqs or .sqf files which can do any number of things, though there are also some more niche kinds of scripts like FSMs that define how AI units behave.\r\n\r\nHowever, the files themselves matter less than the actual code they contain, which can enable you to do all kinds of things you are otherwise totally unable to do in Arma.\r\n\r\n## How Do I Use Scripts?\r\n\r\nScripts may seem daunting and confusing at first, but they're easy to use in three simple steps.\r\n\r\n### 1. Download the Script\r\n\r\nFirstly, you have to <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/zipball/master\">download the script</a> you wish to use.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could make your own script, <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts\">copy the code from my script</a>, and paste it in yours.\r\n\r\n### 2. Place the Script in Your Mission Folder\r\n\r\nSecondly, you need to place the script in the mission folder of the mission you want to use it in, which will probably be in\r\n\r\n<pre>C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Documents\\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\\YourProfileName\\missions\\YourMissionName</pre>\r\n\r\n### 3. Run the Script\r\n\r\nThirdly, you need to execute the script by running code like this:\r\n\r\n<code>scriptDone = [someArguments] execVM \"someScript.sqf\";</code>\r\n\r\n<code>scriptDone</code> is a variable used to determine whether or not the script has completed running. Almost always, you only have to write <code>null</code> for that and never think about it.\r\n\r\n<code>someArguments</code> is an array of parameters or settings you need to send the script so it knows how to work and what to do. Arguments allow you to customize how the script works and what it does. However, every script is different and requires different arguments. Some require very complex arrays of arguments, others require none at all. All my scripts here come with <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/blob/master/README.md\">thorough documentation</a> explaining precisely what you need to write to make them work.\r\n\r\n<code>execVM</code> is a scripting command to execute .sqf scripts, while <code>exec</code> is a command to execute .sqs scripts. Typically, you'll use <code>execVM</code> to run .sqf scripts, which have the unique and powerful ability to wait for something to happen before moving on.\r\n\r\n<code>someScript.sqs</code> or <code>someScript.sqf</code> is the name of the script. Again, the script has to be in the mission folder of the mission you want to use it in.\r\n\r\nAgain, all my scripts here come with <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/blob/master/README.md\">thorough documentation</a> explaining precisely what you need to write to make them work so it'll be simple and easy.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to enable the player to jump - something you can't do in vanilla Arma. Here's what you'd need to do:\r\n\r\n1. Download the <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/blob/master/EnableJump.sqf\">EnableJump.sqf script</a>.\r\n2. Put the EnableJump.sqf script in the mission folder of the mission you want to be able to jump in.\r\n3. Paste <code>null = execVM \"EnableJump.sqf\";</code> in the player's Init box (or anywhere, actually).\r\n\r\nIt works! It's that easy.\r\n\r\n## Is this Code Licensed?\r\n\r\nNo. This code is not licensed. You may use this code freely and may copy, download, fork, and alter it freely. You don't have to cite me as a source, though I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/blob/master/README.md\" width=\"100%\" height=\"1000px\">Here's the <a href=\"https://github.com/LeeCooper6/Arma-Scripts/blob/master/README.md\">thorough documentation</a> explaining precisely what you need to write to make these scripts work.</iframe>",
